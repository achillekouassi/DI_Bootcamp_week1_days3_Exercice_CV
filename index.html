                        </p>
                        <p> I was recruited for the Atos Digital Academy session 2023 training project.
                            This training consisted in the creation of elites in computer development as well as their ease of integration into companies.
                            Indeed, in this training which is intensive, several computer fields are evoked by very great professors. We also learned several common things such
                            as personal development, good behavior in society...
                            All in all, this experience was beneficial to us and helped us
                             of knowledge as that of progression.
